A small plugin to disable the new WebP standard in the settings.

== Description ==

In WordPress 6.1, a WebP version is generated by default when an image is uploaded and displayed in the frontend.

The WebP format generally compresses the images well.

But in certain cases the WebP version can be larger than the original image.

If WebP causes problems on your website, you can disable this function here.
